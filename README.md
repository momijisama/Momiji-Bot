# Momiji-Bot
Yet another bot, this time in the theme of a popular Touhou character

# Required Stuff
- Node v10.16.2
- Discord.js v11.5.1
- Nodemon v1.19.1
- Dotenv v8.2.0

You'll have to Google how to install these, but basically you will just want node_modules in the same directory as dev.bat.

# Before You Run
- You will need to configure the bot via "config - base.json". Rename the file to "config.json" when you are finished.
- You will need to configure ".env - base". Rename the file to ".env" when you are finished.
